# handDetection
Some people have a very bad habit of touching their face or nose which is very 
unhygienic and it also violates the Covid-19 protocols.


So, suppose you are in an online meeting and unknowingly you try to put your hand on 
your face then this is a bad gesture in meeting in front of everyone. In that scenario this 
project can be used.
